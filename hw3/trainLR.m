function theta = trainLR(X, y, lambda)
% TRAINLR  Fits a binary logistic regression model, with intercept.
%         theta = trainLR(X, y) fits a logistic regression model for
%         binary response y and data matrix X.
%
%         X - m x n design matrix of m observations with n features.
%         y - m x 1 vector of labels, either 0 or 1.
%         lambda - regularization term.
%
%         theta - (n+1) x 1 vector of predicted weights.

    [m, n] = size(X);
    theta = randn(n+1,1)*0.01; % initialize the weights randomly.
    
    % First, let's check that your J function's gradient and costs agree.
    A = randn(30, 4);
    A(1, :) = 1;
    B = rand(30, 1) < 0.5;
    checkGradient(@(x) costLR(A, B, x, lambda), randn(4,1));
    
    % Now let's check that your minimization function works.
    assert(abs(minimize(@quad, randn()) - 1) < 1e-2);
    
    % Note: you can swap the order of the checks above if you wish to 
    % implement gradient descent first.
    
    % Note: The logistic regression cost function is convex, which means
    % that if we run gradient descent or a similar method we are guaranteed
    % to approach the global minimum. With L2 regularization, we are
    % further guaranteed that there will be a unique global minimum.
    % Therefore, you should not worry about getting a different set of
    % thetas from us.
    
    % Write your solution below to compute the optimal thetas
    % (Our solution is ~2 lines):
